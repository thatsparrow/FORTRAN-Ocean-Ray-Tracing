This program finds the ray paths beginning at x=x0 and various y in an ocean on x<0 with depth h(x,y)

(1) x-derivative of h is hx(x,y)
(2) y-derivative of h is hy(x,y),
(3) initial number wavenumber is (kx0, ky0)
(4) location along the ray path is (xray,yray)
(5) wavenumber along the ray path is (kxray,kyray)
