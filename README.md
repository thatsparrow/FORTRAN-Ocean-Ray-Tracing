# Ocean Ray Tracing in FORTRAN
@Scripps Institution of Oceanography
@2015

This program finds the ray paths beginning at x=x0 and various y in an ocean on x<0 with depth h(x,y)

the x-derivative of h is hx(x,y)
the y-derivative of h is hy(x,y)
the initial number wavenumber is (kx0, ky0)
the location along the ray path is (xray,yray)
the wavenumber along the ray path is (kxray,kyray)
